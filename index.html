    <p>This is Edward Elric. He is my favourite fictional charater. He is called the Fullmetal Alchemist. He has a brother named Alphonse Elric. Edward and his brother tried to bring their mother back to life with Human Transmutation when they were younger, and they lost part of their bodies doing so. Edward lost his right arm and left leg, and his brother lost his whole body. Edward was able to transmute Alphonse's soul to a suit of armor to save him.</p>
